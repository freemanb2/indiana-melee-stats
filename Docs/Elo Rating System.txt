This Elo rating system is based on the FIDE Elo system as specified here: https://handbook.fide.com/chapter/B022022

Tournaments/Sets should be processed in chronological order. Given a tournament, the winner's bracket sets should be processed before the loser's bracket sets.

Initial Rating: 1200
Rating Range: 1000-3000

Points:
    Bo3:
        2-0 = 1.0
        2-1 = 0.75
        1-2 = 0.25
        0-2 = 0

    Bo5:
        3-0 = 1.0
        3-1 = 0.85
        3-2 = 0.7
        2-3 = 0.3
        1-3 = 0.15
        0-3 = 0

    Rationale:  Taking games is worth something, but winning the set is worth more, so bonus points are awarded for a winning set count.
                Losing a Bo5 in the best case (2-3) is still worth less points than winning a Bo5 in the worst case (2-1). This reinforces the notion that winning sets is worth more than winning games.


Calculation:
    D = difference in rating (up to 400 for calculation)
    PD = scoring probability given D (from linked table)
    Rating Change per match = Points - PD
    Total Rating Change = Sum of rating changes * K
    Scaling Coefficient (K):
        - New Player (Less than 30 tracked sets): 40
        - Experienced Player (30 or more tracked sets): 20
        - Elite Player (Rating at or above 2400): 10

    Rating change is rounded to the nearest whole number. 0.5 rounds up (even when negative).
